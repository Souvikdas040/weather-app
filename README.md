## About The Project

WeatherWise is a modern and responsive web application that provides a clear and concise 5-day weather forecast. Built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS, it offers an intuitive user interface to quickly view essential weather details like daily minimum and maximum temperatures, humidity, and wind speed. The application is designed to adapt seamlessly across various devices, from mobile phones to tablets and desktops.

### Built With

* [React.js](https://react.dev/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - A strongly typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
* [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/) - A modern JavaScript date utility library.
* [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/icons/) - A collection of customizable React icons.
* [Shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) (Implied by `ui/card`) - A collection of re-usable components that you can copy and paste into your apps. *Adjust if you're not actually using shadcn/ui.*

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (LTS version recommended)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your_username/your_weather_repo.git](https://github.com/your_username/your_weather_repo.git)
    cd your_weather_repo
    ```
    *Replace `your_username` and `your_weather_repo` with your actual GitHub username and repository name.*

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # OR
    yarn install
    ```

### Environment Variables

This project requires an API key for fetching weather data. You'll need an API key from a weather service (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI.com).

1.  **Create a `.env` file** in the root of your project directory.
2.  **Add your API key** to this file. The exact variable name depends on how your `ForecastData` is fetched (e.g., if you're using `create-react-app`, it might be `REACT_APP_WEATHER_API_KEY`; for Vite, `VITE_WEATHER_API_KEY`; for Next.js, `NEXT_PUBLIC_WEATHER_API_KEY`).

    Example for Create React App:
    ```env
    REACT_APP_WEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```

    Example for Vite:
    ```env
    VITE_WEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```

    Example for Next.js:
    ```env
    NEXT_PUBLIC_WEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```
    *Make sure the API key variable name matches what your application code expects for fetching data.*

### Running Locally

After installing dependencies and setting up environment variables:

```bash
npm start
# OR
yarn start
